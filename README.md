# web-chat

ChatEngine.io provides full-stack chat tools - which makes adding chat into Node apps easy.

To leverage this tool, we’ll create a Chat Engine project, and store our users in this project. All users in our Chat Engine project can chat with one another through their APIs / platform.

Go to ChatEngine.io, sign up, and create your first project. Once this is done, you’ll see a Project ID and a Private Key.

Use that Project ID and Private Key and place in code.

if any issue let me know...
